# "Fire and the management of late Holocene landscapes in southern Africa"
This code is used to analyze and visualize microcharcoal and radiocarbon data and produce figures for an upcoming publication: 

Davies, B., M. J. Power, D. R. Braun, M. J. Douglass, S. Mosher, L. Quick, I. Esteban, J. Sealy and J. T. Faith, In review. Fire and the management of late Holocene landscapes in southern Africa.
